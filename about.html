		<p2>I’ll cut the fancy talk and be frank with you. My English isn’t too great (never was). And my graphic design skills? Even worse. But writing gave me a way to express myself and convey my ideas. Though I hope to one day adapt some of these stories on the big screen, I’m just glad they exist here.</p2>
		<br>
		<br> 
		<p2>These are not novels or screenplays. They are just story ideas I’ve had since 2017, the year I first started writing. I remember scribbling down The Reflection during my final exams that year. Looking back, the first draft was embarrassing so I fixed it up almost 7 years later.</p2>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p2>In my stories, my cinematic influences are obvious. Christopher Nolan, David Lynch, Andrei Tarkovsky, Ingmar Bergman and the one and only Stanley Kubrick, their works are ingrained in my soul and I can’t produce anything without being consciously or unconsciously influenced by their most defining works. I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve rewatched <i>Stalker</i>just for a creative boost.</p2>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p2>On the literary front, I am fascinated by the works of H.P. Lovecraft, George Orwell, Arthur C. Clarke and Isaac Asimov, to whom I dedicate <i>The Kettle</i>, an upcoming love letter to his masterpiece, <i>The End of Eternity</i>.</p2>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p2>Now about the posters… I won’t lie, they weren’t made with the same attention and care. They are just here to set the tone of the story. If one catches your eye, give the story a shot. Of course, don’t expect a fully refined novel; there’s only so much I can pack in a 10-page summary. If I someday find the time (or discipline) to turn them into feature-length screenplays, I’ll upload them here.</p2>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p2>Still in my younger years, I have mapped out 21 stories I want to tell before I die. You’ll find them <a href ="My Works.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.If any of the unmade ones interest you, hit me up. And if you read something, let me know what you think (good, bad, whatever). Feedback is always appreciated!</p2>
