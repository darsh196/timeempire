	<p2>This (lousy) minimalist website I made overnight is a showcase of my narrative aspirations, featuring summaries destined for cinematic transformation into feature-length screenplays.</p2>
	<br>
	<br> 
	<p2>Spanning 4 to 15 pages, these summaries explore an array of diverse themes â€” time, love, loss, guilt, and the myriad facets of the human psyche. I attempt to explore genres such as science fiction, psychological drama, romance, and at times, the chilling corridors of horror. In these stories, I endeavor to delve into the depths of the human soul, illuminating both its humanity and darkness.</p2>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p2>In crafting these tales, I draw philosophical inspiration from the likes of Nietzsche, Kant, and Sartre, among others. Their profound insights serve as a backdrop, infusing my storylines with a potent elixir of thought and imagination and offering readers a window into the influences that have shaped my creative world.</p2>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p2>As you embark on this journey through my stories, I invite you to discover narratives that resonate with your own experiences and emotions. It is my sincerest hope that these tales captivate you as profoundly as they have inspired me in their creation. Happy reading!</p2>
