	<p2>This (lousy) minimalist website I made overnight is a showcase of my writings, featuring summaries I would love to transform into feature-length screenplays and hopefully, one day, into actual movies.</p2>
	<br>
	<br> 
	<p2>Spanning 4 to 20 pages, these summaries explore themes that I feel strongly connected to â€” time, love, loss, guilt, and the myriad facets of the human psyche. I attempt to explore genres such as science fiction, psychological drama, romance, and at times, horror. In these stories, I plunge into the depths of the human soul, trying to expose both its humanity and darkness.</p2>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p2>In crafting these tales, I draw philosophical inspiration from the likes of Nietzsche, Kant, and Sartre, among others. Their insights serve as a backdrop, hopefully infusing my storylines with thought and imagination and offering readers a window into the influences that have shaped my creative world.</p2>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p2>As you embark on this journey through these stories, I hope they also resonate with your own experiences and emotions. Your feedback is also always much appreciated. Happy reading!</p2>
