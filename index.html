	<p2>So I made this (lousy) minimalist website to share some of my writings, more specifically, summaries of story ideas I would love to transform into feature-length screenplays. And maybe, just maybe, into actual movies.</p2>
	<br>
	<br> 
	<p2>Spanning 4 to 20 pages, they explore some themes I feel strongly connected to — time, love, loss, guilt, and the mess that is the human psyche. I attempt to explore genres such as science fiction, psychological drama, romance, and at times, horror when the mood strikes. In these stories, I want to venture into the depths of the human soul, trying to expose both its beauty and darkness.</p2>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p2>While writing these tales, I drew philosophical inspiration from the likes of Nietzsche, Kant, and Schopenhauer, among others. Their ideas weave their way into my storylines, hoping they’ll infuse them with something meaningful and worthwhile.</p2>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p2>If anything here resonates with you (whether it sparks a thought, an emotion, or just a raised eyebrow) your feedback is always welcome. In the meantime, happy reading!</p2>
